                            The epiphyses of the 5th proximal and middle phalanges are now as wide as their shafts.<br><br>
                            Metacarpals: An indentation has developed in the articular surface of the epiphysis of the 1st metacarpal.<br><br>
                            Carpals: The distal half of the triquetrum has enlarged and its hamate surface has begun to adjust to the shape of that bone.
                            The outline of the tip of the hamulus of the hamate is now discernible.
                            The scaphoid and radial articular surfaces of the lunate are beginning to be defined.<br><br>

                            Phalanges: The epiphyses of the proximal and middle phalanges of the 2nd-5th fingers and the distal phalanges of the thumb, 2nd, 4th, and 5th fingers now cap their shafts. This capping is more pronounced on the radial tips.<br><br>
                            Metacarpals: As the epiphysis of the 1st metacarpal enlarges, it conforms more closely to the shape of the adjacent surface of the trapezium and to that of its own shaft.
                            The epiphyses of the 2nd-5th metacarpals are now as wide as the distal ends of their shafts, to which they conform closely in shape.
                            The base of the 2nd metacarpal has shaped further to the adjacent surface of the trapezoid.
                            The adductor pollicis and flexor pollicis brevis sesamoids have begun to ossify. The flexor sesamoid can be seen through the head of the 1st metacarpal, directly opposite the adductor sesamoid.<br><br>
                            Carpals: The medial half of the trapezium now projects distally toward the base of the 2nd metacarpal, with which it will later articulate.
                            The hook of the hamulus appears as a triangular outline within the shadow of the hamate.
                            Further reciprocal shaping has occurred in the adjacent surfaces of the capitate and scaphoid.<br><br>
                            Radius/Ulna: The proximal margin of the radial epiphysis has adjusted further to the shape of the distal end of its shaft.
                            The ulnar epiphysis is shaping to the adjacent surface of the radius and to the radial portion of the end of its own shaft.<br><br>

                            The carpals in the proximal row are only slightly less advanced in their differentiation.
                            The definitive shape of the joint between the scaphoid, trapezoid, and trapezium is now established.
                            The surface of the trapezium which articulates with the 1st metacarpal has become more concave.<br><br>
                            Radius/Ulna: The radial epiphysis caps its shaft and its ulnar articular surface has flattened.
                            The epiphysis of the ulna has shaped further to the distal end of its shaft, and its styloid process has become more prominent.<br><br>
